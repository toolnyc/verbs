Please handle the following improvements in the order most efficient and least error prone.

UX
- Need to add the party countdown timer or other visual indication of upcoming party to the clickable link (need to be apparent that the largest verb is in fact the upcoming party)
- Admin dashboard seems to force reload on adding new DJ's and if there are pending changes to other bits of text, those are nuked; would love to avoid this behavior if possible



Design
- Would love to add some sort of inkbleed noise or overlay texture that can distress the site a bit without degrading performance or UX (not on admin site tho)
- If easy, would like to add hover color selection for each event in the admin dashboard (i.e. can pick from a brand color so long as it's not white/meets accessibility standards)
- The bottom navbar only has the spinning component of the logo but should have the "non-spin component" sit directly behind it. Ask questions about this implementation if you do not understand. These are meant to fit togther like puzzle pieces. 
- Remove bits of low-opacity or low-saturation brand blue as background. This seems present in the admin dashboard most frequently. Backgrounds should be exculusively brand white unless otherwise specified. 

Functionality
-Post purchase sends me to a non-existent success page. Please re-direct to a success specific page that can receive props from the purchased event and display a downloadable or saveable confirmation page with an order number or something that would be searchable on admin side. If easy to implement a QR code generator would be awesome or something.  Actually now that I mention it let's add a section to the admin side that allows admins to view list of attendees for a certain event & bypass payment / add to guestlist.
