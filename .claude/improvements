# Improvements - All Completed

## Round 1 - Completed

### Player design
- Reordered layout to prioritize controls
- Title appears on hover as tooltip
- Width fits content

### Footer / logo
- Inlined SVG with explicit white colors (`fill="#fff"`, `stroke="#fff"`)
- Outer ring stays static, inner content spins

### Loading states
- Added 600ms minimum display time
- Persists state across ViewTransitions
- Visual: dark background pill with white spinning logo

### GSAP hover animations
- Wrapped in reusable function with cleanup
- Re-initializes on `astro:page-load`

---

## Round 2 - Completed

### 1. Minimized player too small
**Fixed:** Increased collapsed player height from 28px to 36px, mini buttons from 20px to 28px with borders, progress bar from 80px to 100px

### 2. Loading state not visible
**Fixed:**
- Increased minimum display time to 600ms
- Added dark background pill with padding
- Added shadow for visibility
- Used `filter: invert(1)` to make logo white on dark background
- Fixed state persistence across ViewTransitions using window globals

### 3. Non-spin logo part not visible
**Fixed:** Added explicit white colors as SVG attributes (`fill="#fff"`, `stroke="#fff"`) instead of relying on CSS inheritance which doesn't work well with SVG

### 4. Next party countdown broken
**Fixed:**
- Added proper ViewTransitions handling with `astro:page-load` listener
- Clears and re-creates interval on page navigation
- Added NaN check for invalid dates
- Used window global to prevent multiple intervals
